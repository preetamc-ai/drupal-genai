## How to create your own Field Widget Action plugin

Create a plugin class in `Plugin\FieldWidgetAction` namespace. It is recommended to extend `FieldWidgetActionBase` class
in order to focus on functionality of your plugin itself and not do any form integration. Of course you can implement
all methods from the `FieldWidgetActionInterface` on your own. For actions with suggestions there are two helper methods
in the base class:
- `returnSuggestions` that will help to display the suggestions in a modal dialog with ability to use selected value in
  the form field directly in case the form element selector is provided;
- `getSuggestionsTarget` - that gets the selector for the most common use cases of a suggestions action. In special
  cases the plugin can overwrite the method to use its own logic.
- `getTargetElementDelta` - that gets the delta for the field widget form element.
- `getTargetElementFieldName` - that gets the corresponding field name of the form element.

The methods are protected ones, therefore, they are not part of the interface (as not all actions
provide suggestions).

### IMPORTANT NOTE

Depending on field type and field widget the form element that will be updated can be changed. By default it is `value`
as a lot of field types have one property that is also main property. But in case you create a plugin for entity
reference or image alt text, you need to specify the form element in your plugin class by overriding the constant
`FORM_ELEMENT_PROPERTY`. For example for entity reference field type the constant should be set to this:
```php
const FORM_ELEMENT_PROPERTY = 'target_id';
```
For alt text in image widget:
```php
const FORM_ELEMENT_PROPERTY = 'alt';
```
And so on.
